Lecturing on **Aging Population in the Global Warming Era** in the **Iran-China Joint Workshop on Emerging Technologies and Methods for Climate Resilience**

About the Workshop  
======  
This workshop explores the intersection of global warming, extreme heat, and the rapidly aging population, with a focus on Iranâ€™s unique demographic and climatic challenges. Drawing on recent IPCC projections and international vulnerability models, we discuss how urban planning, policy, and technical solutions can build resilience for aging communities facing increasing heat threats.

Workshop Objectives:
======
- Understand how global warming intensifies heat risks for older adults
- Analyze vulnerability factors using recent data and spatial models
- Identify governmental and technical strategies for boosting community heat resilience
- Promote climate justice and policy innovation for vulnerable populations

Key Topics Covered:
======
- Global and regional heat trends and projections (IPCC, 2025)
- Demographic trends and the aging population in Iran
- Governmental and technical solutions for enhancing the aging population's heat resilience
- Urban planning and design for heat resilience using the WHO Age Friendly City framework
