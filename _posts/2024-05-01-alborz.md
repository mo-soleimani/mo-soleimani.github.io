I am so delighted and grateful to announce that this year, I won the Alborz Scientific National Award, on its 62nd anniversary, due to my efforts and research in the urban planning field focusing on the improvement of the cities' quality of life. The Alborz Prize, also known as the Iranian Nobel, has been supported by the donation of HosseinAli Alborz for more than six decades and is the most prestigious non-governmental scientific award in Iran. Ultimately, I wholeheartedly thank all my professors at the University of Tehran and Art University of Isfahan for their unwavering support.
